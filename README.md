Programming Projects I have worked on

##### CSCI 201 Project
This is a website I worked on for my CSCI 201 Final Project at USC.
My group and I worked on making a website where you can play poker. 
I worked on the front-end and back-end for this project.

##### Inertial Builds
These are the release candidate builds of my CTIN 489 Project. 
I worked as the sole programmer, with Cecile Zhang as the lead artist, 
and our audio team from Berklee: audio director James Morell, composer Kai, and sound designer Helena Liu.
